    Michael would navigate in his browser to our homepage. There will be an area to browse health articles, which he could <br>
    flip through there on the homepage. If he would like a specified search, there will be a search bar for him to use near <br>
    the browsing area. He would type in the subject, click a button to initiate the search, and it would bring him to our <br>
    health articles page showing articles related to his desired topic. If he wishes to save an article upon seeing the <br>
    buttons to do so under the article titles, and he clicks on one of those buttons, he would then be prompted to create an account on <br>
    the site, which would then allow him to do so.

    Michael would navigate in his browser to our homepage. There will be an area to browse health articles, which he could <br>
    flip through there on the homepage. If he would like a specified search, there will be a search bar for him to use near <br>
    the browsing area. He would type in a subject, click a button to initiate the search, and the computer would find <br>
    articles related to his search in our database. This would also automatically take him to our health articles page.  There <br>
    would be a list of articles related to his search. If he wishes to save an article upon seeing the buttons to do so near the article <br>
    titles, and he clicks on one of those buttons, the computer will prompt him to create an account on the site, and <br>
    doing this would then allow him to save articles as he chooses.
